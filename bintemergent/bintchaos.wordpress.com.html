			<p>Eversince the China stock market devalued by 65% I have been fascinated by the markets&#8211; are we on the brink of some global market collapse or just another [10x as big] subprime bubble?  The indispensible Zerohedge distills <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-09-18/three-reasons-why-us-government-should-default-its-debt-today">the essence of market reality</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>One way of putting an annual deficit of, say, $700 billion into perspective is to compare it to the value of all publicly traded stocks in the U.S., which are worth roughly $20 trillion. The current U.S. government debt of $18 trillion is rapidly approaching the stock value of all public corporations &#8212; and that’s true even with stocks at bubble-like highs. If the annual deficit continues at the $700 billion rate &#8212; in fact it is likely to accelerate &#8212; the government will borrow the equivalent of the entire equity capital base of the country, which has taken more than 200 years to accumulate, in only 29 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am thinking of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">technological singularity</a>, that is supposed to deliver us functional Strong AI&#8230;at the point above the knee of the exponential curve where the asymptote approaches vertical.  It seems to me we are witnessing a <strong>Debt Singularity</strong> &#8212; the natural evolved result of the monetization of debt.</p>
<p>So what happens neXt is anybody&#8217;s guess&#8211; the only thing im sure of is <strong>Collapse.</strong></p>
<p>And we will deal with that in my neXt blogpost. <span class='wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile' title=':)'>:)</span></p>

			<p><a href="https://bintchaos.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/screen-shot-2015-06-11-at-7-28-09-am.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-102" src="https://bintchaos.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/screen-shot-2015-06-11-at-7-28-09-am.png?w=700" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-11 at 7.28.09 AM"   /></a></p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;m enchanted with Abdel Bari Atwan&#8217;s book The Digital Caliphate.  There is some amazing perception and study at work.  I&#8217;m particularily interested in the concept of jihadi-cool.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Islamic State, according to Atwan, is also presented as an emotionally attractive place where people “belong,” where everyone is a “brother” or “sister.” A kind of slang, melding adaptations or shortenings of Islamic terms with street language, is evolving among the English-language fraternity on social media platforms in an attempt to create a “jihadi cool.” A jolly home life is portrayed via Instagram images where fighters play with fluffy kittens and jihadist “poster-girls” proudly display the dishes they have created.</p></blockquote>
<p>Atwan doesn&#8217;t quite get this correct&#8211; jihadi-cool isnt &#8220;attempt to create&#8221;  like a social engineering experiment (eg, <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9251/index1.html">the infamous US Rand Muslim project</a>).  Cool cant be forced.  The <a href="https://twitter.com/urbandictionary">Urban Dictionary</a> is permeated with arabic terms&#8211; khalas and bint or binty are really common.   And Atwan misses the part about where everyone is also an Abu or Umm (father or mother).  Procreation rules, marriage talk mixed with quranic quotes and marital naseeha.  The mujahiddeen do really love cats and kids&#8211; also horses and lions&#8211; this is pretty obvious.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t a lot of jihadist &#8220;poster-girls&#8221; displayed&#8211; they all wear niqab, but sometimes its tastefully accessorized with an AK47 or a bomb belt.</p>
<p>Theres been a lot of research devoted to the Science of Cool&#8211; but mostly its obsessive about how to monetize coolness, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cool-Brains-Hidden-Drives-Economy/dp/0374129185">Steven Quartz&#8217;s nakedly capitalistic book </a>.  Perhaps jihadi-cool could be useful to explain why <a href="https://twitter.com/khanserai">Humera Khanserai</a> and Team CVE cant get any traction with a counternarrative.</p>
<blockquote><p>1.  Jihadis look cool&#8211; like ninjas or video game warriors&#8211; gangstah and thuggish even&#8211; the opposition doesnt. Its mostly middleaged white guys with a smidgin of scared straight ex-mujahids and a couple middleaged women.</p>
<p>2. Jihadis are mostly young&#8211; Team CVE mostly isn&#8217;t.  The median age of muslims is a whopping 9 years younger than non-muslims.</p>
<p>3. Jihadis have cool weapons.  And cool nasheeds.</p>
<p>4. Jihadis have young fiery imams that fight on the battlefield.  Team CVE has ancient creaky dollar scholars and greybearded fatties nuzzling up to the madkhali trough while spouting John Kerry &#8220;airstrike fatawa&#8221;.</p>
<p>5. And this is the most important&#8211; salafi-jihadism made being pious cool.  It became cool to quote aya and study Quran.  And CVE has absolutely no defense against this.  When IS started up last year there was a thing called Sahaba nights, where baqiya twitter grouped up and told stories of the Companions of the Prophet&#8211; the storytelling that Dr. Carroll is such a fan of.</p></blockquote>
<p>I love jihadi cant&#8211; dem, bait, preeing, binty, akhi&#8230; its like Belter dialect in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_%28novel_series%29">the Expanse</a>.  And it borrows from all languages&#8211; because jihad draws from all races and ethnicities. The voice of youth counterculture and revolution for an underclass.  Like ghetto culture in the US&#8211; the inexorable evolution of cool.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In mathematics a priori data is generally considered an excellent thing.  Im encouraged to see Army Chief of Staffs Gen. Odierno actually understands Bayes Law.  For fellow mathheads here is a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BayesTheorem.html">Wolfram refresher</a>&#8212; here is the <a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/">layman version</a> for the rest of you.  Its interesting to me that some humans actually think in equations&#8211; not just as shorthand for verbal knowledge.  Probably Gen Odierno is not an equation thinker&#8211; but he does have some pattern recognition skills.  That is apparent from this statement&#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>Odierno is particularly qualified to discuss the prospect of success and failure in Iraq, given that he’s spent six years in the region. For two of those years, from 2008 to 2010, he served as head of all foreign troops, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/us-army-chief-futile-send-150-000-soldiers-180626655.html">CS Monitor reports</a>.</p>
<p>“We went in and fixed it once,” <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/general-ray-odierno-president-obama-iraq-troop-increase-strategy-combat-isis/" target="_blank">Odierno said, according to CBS</a>, during a Thursday appearance. “It took us a while — it took us longer than we wanted it to — but we fixed it. The security was good, the economy was growing. We handed it off to them, and here we are three, four years later, and ISIS has been in control, has really had an impact on the security of the Iraqi people, and is now threatening the region in a much greater way.”</p>
<p>“I could put 150,000 soldiers on the ground and defeat ISIS? Yes. But then what?” he added. “A year later it would be right back to where we are today.”</p></blockquote>
<div>How has Gen. Odierno arrived at his conclusion?  Bayes Law and pattern recognition.  I&#8217;m pretty sure Odierno reads Atwan, who is easily the <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/author/abdel-bari-atwan">best analyst out there on the Islamic State.</a></div>
<div>
<div id="main" class="column grid-12">
<div class="column grid-8 alpha omega"></div>
<div id="main-content" class="column grid-8 alpha omega">
<blockquote><p>As the US ramps up airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Raqqa—the self-styled Caliphate’s capital—and the UK mulls further military involvement, it is surely time to ponder the effectiveness of bombarding densely populated areas, causing civilian deaths and casualties and laying waste to homes and infrastructure.</p></blockquote>

<div class="entry-content">
<blockquote><p>After fourteen years in Afghanistan and ten in Iraq (not to mention the drone campaigns in Yemen and Pakistan), isn’t it obvious that a military solution is impossible and that, in terms of ‘hearts and minds’, such missions are counter-productive, often propelling ‘moderate’ Muslims into the arms of the extremists?</p>
<p><strong>The evolution of IS</strong>IS has not sprung from nowhere. It is the latest evolutionary step in the Salafi-jihadi movement, specifically the global jihadi, anti-American tendency introduced by Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1996. This strand has an explicit goal of re-establishing the Caliphate and expanding it through the Middle East, parts of Africa, much of Asia and southern Europe.</p>
<p>Much as we would like to think so, this is not empty rhetoric. Nobody in the west took Osama bin Laden seriously&#8230;until 9/11. The approach to IS displays a more culpable nonchalance when its soldiers have seized whole cities like Mosul, Raqqa and Ramadi, when oil installations and major dams are under their control and when they have effectively dissolved the Iraq-Syria border by establishing new <em>wilayats (</em>provinces) which straddle it.</p>
<p>The response is always the same: bomb the hell out them. But the assumption that military superiority will win the day has not only been proved wrong, it is arguably directly responsible for the evolution of IS.</p>
<p>Al Qaeda used to have one address—the caves in Tora Bora (where I spent three days with Osama bin Laden in 1996 as detailed in my first book, <em><a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520255616">The Secret History of al-Qaeda</a></em>). When the US wanted to retaliate for 9/11, it knew where to find the leaders, and their daisy cutter bombs all but annihilated the organisation.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As Atwan points out, the evolution of IS is directly attributable to US intervention in the form of the OIF and OEF invasion and occupations.  Atwan also notes the origins of  AlQaeda are rooted in the Algerian coup.</div>
<blockquote>
<div>This fear of Islamism has created both the space and the appetite for extremism—the same thing happened in Algeria when Islamists won the 1990 elections but were violently prevented from taking office by the army, abetted by France and Washington. Civil war ensued, eventually producing al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>The reason the US doesn&#8217;t have a strategy is there is no strategy.  Like Odierno says, continued repression of islamic government in majority muslim nations will only result in more extreme and more viscious <em>adaptive</em> versions of jihadi-salafism.  We can say, <em>fitter</em> versions of IS.  IS is beautifully adapted to an environment where US is trying to exterminate it&#8211; bombing it makes it better.  Mathematically, IS is an antifragile hydra, a distributed insurgency that gains from disorder.  Atwan again.</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>and order. Today, in Iraq and Syria, where central government has all but collapsed, those who have not fled advancing IS troops have extended a wary welcome, and IS enjoys considerable support from influential and warlike Sunni tribes in both countries.</p>
<p>We cannot ignore the feebleness of the national army in Iraq (for reasons we have outlined above), whose brigades simply run away when IS attacks. The government and its western backers have been relying on Shi’a militias to battle the extremists—but they are just as vicious and prone to committing atrocities as IS; Kurdish forces have also been deployed, but their agenda is essentially separatist.</p>
<p>Despite official declarations to the contrary, there is a lot of support for extremist groups among the elite in major US/UK regional allies Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries. This presents London and Washington with something of a dilemma, hence the focus on ‘moderate’ Islamist groups and the flagging up of internecine fighting between, say, al-Qaeda, al-Nusra and IS or the Taliban and IS.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So here is where Bayes Law comes in&#8211; like General Odierno says, crushing IS will just result in the evolution of a super IS&#8211; more adaptive and exploitive, more extreme and hardened.  It has happened before (a priori data) in Algeria, in Iraq and Syria, and now in Sham and Libya and Nigeria and Somalia.</div>
<div>Maybe the only strategy that can work is to allow Sunni muslims self government?</div>
<div>Stay tuned for my next posting&#8211; the Islamic State in the Iterated Game</div>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In Part I of Embracing Apocalypse I delineated the way the Islamic State is anchored in the past as part of an evolved adaptation: multidimensional and multi-generational.  The pervasive influence of Ibn Taymiyya, al Shayyk al Islam cannot be overestimated. In Part II I want to discuss the instantiation of the Islamic State in the present, and most particularily the memetic inerrency of the Uncreated Quran and the certainty of <em>prophetic knowledge</em>.</p>
<p>The way I became muminah, a believer, was the Quran. It hit me like a tidal wave.  And that is the core problem for all the jihadologists and political scientists cranking out books and making a living from the monetizing of islamic &#8220;terrorism&#8221;&#8211; to understand Islam one must contemplate Quran&#8230;but if one contemplates Quran, one becomes muslim.</p>
<p>Here is a pretty good description of Taymiyya&#8217;s <a href="https://www.academia.edu/1207707/Ibn_Taymiyya_and_the_Rise_of_Radical_Hermeneutics_An_Analysis_of_An_Introduction_to_the_Foundations_of_Quranic_Exegesis">radical hermeneutics</a> based on his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Explanation-Al-Islam-Taymiyyahs-Introduction-Principles/dp/1898649820">Introduction to Principles of Tafsir</a>.  The only thing the monograph glosses over is Taymiyya&#8217;s insistance on an arabic Quran, which I believe is critical.  In the West it is often said that Islam needs a &#8220;reformation&#8221;, like protestantism or reform judaism.  But the problem for everyone desperately trying to craft a more &#8220;moderate&#8221; version of Islam is that <em>tafsir</em> has already had its reformation in the person of Ibn Taymiyya.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="ff1"><span class="g"><span class="a">The small treatise </span></span><span class="a">Muqaddima fī uṣūl al-tafsīr (An Introduction to the</span><span class="a"> Foundations of Qur’ānic Exegesis) by Ibn Taymiyya has had a </span><span class="a">remarkable influence on the history of Qur’ānic exegesis. Barely 15 </span><span class="a">folios, it not only proclaims a new hermeneutical program that </span><span class="a">became the foundation for a subgenre of <em>tafsīr</em> that would generate </span><span class="a">several major Qur’ānic commentaries, but it boldly attempts to </span><span class="a">overhaul the entire history of Qur’ānic exegesis.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="ff1">So Taymiyya completely changed the model for quranic exegesis, in ways that would shape the contemporary Islamic State centuries after his death.  My particular interest is in the transformation of <em>tafsir</em> into <em>prophetic knowledge</em>.</div>
<div class="ff1">
<blockquote>
<div class="ff1"><span class="a">Thus the transformation </span><span class="a">here, though subtle, is nonetheless profound: the Prophet is </span><span class="a">presented as having commented on the Qur’ān, in the manner of an </span><span class="a">exegete, to his Companions and hence there is another corpus of </span><span class="a">prophetic material that is, strictly speaking, not part of the </span><span class="a">traditional understanding of the Sunna. The Sunna in turn is </span><span class="a">understood by Ibn Taymiyya to include a prophetic commentary on </span><span class="a">the Qur’ān. Granted he does not explicitly make this point, yet it is </span><span class="a">an inescapable conclusion that follows from the import of his </span><span class="a">statements in this chapter.</span></div>
<div class="ff1"><span class="a">Ibn Taymiyya’s aim is thus to turn the </span><span class="a">commentary literature into prophetic knowledge, and as such </span><span class="a">interpretation itself, as issuing from an infallible individual, </span><span class="a">becomes a type of knowledge that is in agreement with his definition </span><span class="a">of what constitutes knowledge. One needs only to verify that it is </span><span class="a">indeed from Muḥammad for it to become authoritative. Hence </span><span class="a">inherited interpretations are to be assessed in the same way as one </span><span class="a">assesses Hadith, using the customary tools of the science of </span><span class="a">Hadith.</span></div>
<div class="ff1"><span class="a">This is a rather radical redefinition of Qur’ānic exegesis—</span><span class="a">elevating it to the level of <em>prophetic knowledge</em>.</span></div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another important concept developed by Taymiyya is the idea of the Quran being self-defining.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="ff1"><span class="a">Explaining the Qur’ān with the Sunna is a common </span><span class="a">enough hermeneutical Sunni strategy that is not surprising here. It </span><span class="a">is the notion of interpreting the Qur’ān with the Qur’ān that seems </span><span class="a">to be the novelty. This hermeneutical device is not unknown in the </span><span class="a">tradition; many examples from the interpretive tradition show that </span><span class="a">the exegetes were well aware of this possibility as a method of </span><span class="a">interpreting the Qur’ān.  It is Ibn Taymiyya’s placing it at the top </span><span class="a">of a hierarchical order of interpretation that is the interesting </span><span class="a">development here.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="ff1">In modern terms this means the Quran is recursive&#8211; it is defined in terms of itself.  This is a very powerful armor against innovation or what John Kerry unfortunately called &#8220;airstrike fatawa&#8221;.  I like to call it the wall of recursion&#8211; the Quran is self-similiar.</div>
<div class="ff1">
<blockquote>
<div class="ff1"><span class="a">What Ibn Taymiyya was doing was replicating in </span><span class="a">the interpretation of the Qur’ān the same steps one followed in the </span><span class="a">discovery of God’s law, as formulated by the Sunni jurists. According </span><span class="a">to Sunni legal theory, the sources of the Sharī‘a are the Qur’ān, the </span><span class="a">Sunna, the consensus of the community and juristic analogy; the</span><span class="a">first two elements in both theories are thus the same. The brilliant </span><span class="a">stroke on the part of Ibn Taymiyya is to draw this parallel between </span><span class="a">the two systems. He makes his theory almost impossible to unseat </span><span class="a">as long as one also upholds the rules of the Sunni juristic practices </span><span class="a">as outlined in uṣūl al-fiqh manuals.</span></div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="ff1">A year ago I became interested in the rise of the Islamic State, and this correlated with the beginning of my love for Ibn Taymiyya.  The mujahiddeen I talked to on twitter (back before talking to mujahiddeen on twitter became a criminal offense) patiently explained to me that Ibn Taymiyya was the dominant scholar of ISIS, followed by his students Ibn Qayyim and Ibn Kathir.   This is observably true in reading Aymenn Al-Tamimi&#8217;s carefully curated collection of IS fatawa&#8211; jurisprudence of the State is strongly informed by Taymiyyan scholarship.</div>
<div class="ff1"></div>
<div class="ff1">We can see how Taymiyya&#8217;s introduction of radical hermeneutics armors quranic <em>meaning</em> against both in-group mutation and out-group penetration.  So when President Obama talks about beating IS with <em>ideas,</em> I simply do not see that happening.  For example, its not going to be possible to impose acceptance of Shi&#8217;a theology on Sunni populations.  Its not possible to cherrypick the Quran or twist its meanings because it is a synchronous self-referential whole.</div>
<div class="ff1"></div>
<div class="ff1">So now that we have a toolset to transform <em>tafsir</em> into <em>prophetic knowledge</em>, we can project that into the future carried by the vector of the uncreated, revealed Quran&#8211; outside time and space.  And that will be Part III.</div>
<div class="ff1">ramadan mubarak!</div>

			<blockquote><p>Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626). &#8220;Revenge is a kind of wild justice: which the more man&#8217;s nature runs to, the more ought law to weed it out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Having just browsed through a sample of the typical blindfolded attempts to &#8220;understand&#8221; and thereby &#8220;defeat&#8221; the Islamic State I thought perhaps I would clarify something for the massive clique of western political &#8220;scientists&#8221; toiling endlessly for coin in the Jihadology Mines.  I don&#8217;t even read Brookings output anymore, finding it to be near universally worthless.  But the great part of this conflict is a contest between two different systems of consensual rule of law: man&#8217;s law (secular democracy) and God&#8217;s law (shariah).</p>
<blockquote><p>وَلَكُمْ فِي الْقِصَاصِ حَيَاةٌ يَا أُولِي الْأَلْبَابِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</p>
<p>&#8220;there is [a saving of] life for you in Al-Qisas [the Law of Equality in punishment], O men of understanding, that you may become Al-Muttaqun&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So I will say that what <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/programs/tm/single/?tx_ttnews[tt_news]=44030&amp;cHash=8e2c776b9fa5b40119a8dfc05b5c3ebf#.VYlXkKPLcd7">Charlie Winter calls brutality</a>, and what other western analysts like Hassan Hassan <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/21/three-sisters-nine-children-what-is-the-lure-of-the-isis-caliphate?CMP=share_btn_tw">call savagery or barbarism</a> appeals to recruits and citizens and sunni muslims and global youth on two levels&#8211; as revenge and as law.</p>
<p>Revenge is one of the most potent human drives, organically speaking.  The neuroreceptors for revenge are co-located in the same area of the neo-cortex as those for opiates and sex.  Revenge can become addictive, like opiates and sex.  The neuro-hormone cascade rewards revenge behavior in the perception of vengence justice&#8211; there are many studies on this.  The human neocortex is also strongly oriented towards visual impact.  It is gobsmackingly obvious why a revenge/justice narrative would appeal to youth recruits&#8211; in the past decade 9 million sunni muslims have died as a result of the US Global War on Terror.  Hard to ignore the causality there&#8211; it is a greater holocaust than that visited on the jews.</p>
<p>Like Sir Francis says it is necessary to weed out revenge in western law&#8211; but like much of shariah, Allah&#8217;s law &#8220;manages&#8221; revenge&#8211; harnesses its power and shapes it instead of trying to suppress it.  That is what Qisas is.  The Wali [protector] of the victim is allowed leeway in choosing the punishment.  The Islamic State considers itself the Wali of the Ummah at this point, after 9 million dead Ahlus Sunnah wa Jammal.  I have to believe that is why western polysci analysts so fiercely ignore the basic facts of the legitimacy of the Islamic State.  They can&#8217;t acknowledge any guilt or responsibility for the 9 million muslim dead.</p>
<p>But again the facts on the ground are that muslims will make up one quarter of the global population by 2050 and the great majority will be Sunni muslims, concentrated in ME, Africa, &amp; Indonesia.  There will be one billion youth in Africa by 2050, most of those in the sunni muslim belts of North Africa and Subsaharan Africa.  The ME is 87% sunni and 60% youth today.</p>
<p>It is simply not possible to wipeout the Islamic State.  All the billions of dollars and billions of words poured out on futile plans to degrade/destroy it signify zero understanding of demographics, history, and science.</p>
<p>Like Dr. Scott Atran says&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>“The caliphate as an idea has never gone away,” Atran says, “And now that it is here again after a hiatus of nearly 100 years, as a concrete matter of fact, it will focus the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of people. The critical question is not, ‘How can we thwart or destroy the caliphate?’ because attempts to do that will likely backfire. Rather the question is, ‘How can we live with and transform the idea and reality of a caliphate – and one that will be nuclear-capable probably sooner rather than later – into something that does not threaten other peoples’ ways of life?’ That is a question for everyone, but it is not even on our political radar.”</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="https://bintchaos.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-10-at-4-11-49-am.png"><img class="alignnone size-big-brother-logo wp-image-70" src="https://bintchaos.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-10-at-4-11-49-am.png?w=242&#038;h=406" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-10 at 4.11.49 AM" width="242" height="406" /></a>So perhaps I will write a book one day.  Or more than one.  But this particular hypothetical book would be titled <strong>Embracing Apocalypse</strong>&#8212; and the cover art would be this picture.</p>
<p>This iconic photo of the famous Tunisian mujahid Abu Ahmad at-Tunisian on the ruined streets of Kobane distills the whole conflict into one image for me.  To glory in apocalypse, to embrace it.  To use apocalypse as a tool in multiple dimensions.  This is a wholly alien concept for the west&#8211; the US especially seeks to armor itself against apocalypse, and both dreads and fears it.  This is obvious from the spate of movies flowing from Hollywood&#8211; classic apocalypse movies like <strong>San Andreas</strong> or <strong>2012</strong> and post-apocalyptic dystopian world of the future movies like <strong>Mad Max: FuryRoad, the Purge, Divergent, Hunger Games, Snowpiercer,</strong> and <strong>Interstellar</strong>.  Movies are the mirror of culture.  The paranoia induction that has infused the US since 9/11 bleeds out into the culture as fear and dread&#8230;a kind of prophecy of doom&#8211; fear of retribution perhaps from the burgeoning non-white global populations?  Or justice for the horror show the US has created in MENA and Africa?  Who can say.</p>
<p>In contrast the muslim world weaves prophecy seamlessly into culture.  But the Islamic State takes incorporating prophetic methodology to a whole new level&#8211; the <em>embrace of Apocalypse</em>, as something eminently to be desired and fervently worked towards.   In another Hollywood movie, <strong>The Edge of Tomorrow</strong> (this one of the Alien Invasion genre) one of the characters says &#8220;the enemy that sees the future cannot be defeated.&#8221;  Although the plucky Tom Cruise does manage to defeat the prescient Aliens in the end, he does it by making his version of the future come true.  My consideration of IS is &#8220;and what of the enemy that not only <em>sees</em> the future, but <em>creates</em> the future&#8221;?  Because that is how the Islamic State operates.  Much has been made of the fatawa allowing the taking of polytheist slaves.  Yet for IS this is fulfilling prophecy, one of the minor signs.</p>
<blockquote><p>The slavegirl will give birth to her master. [Bukhari and Muslim]</p></blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend two excellent books, <em>Hassan and Weiss</em>: <strong>Inside the Army of Terror</strong>, and <em>Jean-Pierre Filiu</em>: <strong>Apocalypse in Islam: </strong>Hassan for a finely tuned history of the evolution of IS from AQ, and Filiu for the detailed analysis of the different strains of prophecy.  I learnt a lot about the history of Operation Iraqi Freedom that I hadn&#8217;t known and the sorry role the US played in shaping IS into an implacable enemy with near infinite population resource resupply and an impenetrable ideology that resembles a forward error correcting code.  The latter is evidenced by the continued profound failure of the West to craft an appealing counternarrative to jihadi-salafism.</p>
<p>Hassan Hassan really gets it&#8211; the multidimensional scope of IS ideology.  Ibn Taymiyya anchors IS in the past, instantiates IS in the present, and projects IS into the future.  The paradigm is both intellectually parsimonious and elegant.  Ibn Taymiyya is Shaykh al Islam&#8211; calling IS khawarij is tantamount to calling Taymiyya khawarij&#8211; Taymiyya makes IS unimpeachable in their claim to be islamic&#8211; he confers immunity on them.  In Taymiyya&#8217;s time the Uleema were utterly corrupt and the Shia had allied with the Mamluk rulers, much like the present day Uleema and the Shia in Syria and Iraq.  Its indisputable that an analogous environment is reproduced in the contemporary Middle East.</p>
<p>Hanbali manhaj is both the strictest and the most widely followed of the four canonical schools of Sunni Islam:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[Hanbali manhaj]&#8230;affirming the uncreated character of the Quran and rejecting the possibilty of free interpretation, which placed it in irreconcilable opposition to Shiism.&#8221;&#8211; Filiu</p></blockquote>
<p>Ibn Taymiyya was the champion of Hanbali literalism and this deeply informed the apocalyptic vision of one of his students: Ibn Kathir.  In Filiu Ibn Kathir&#8217;s chapter is fittingly called &#8220;The Apocalypse of Revenge&#8221;.  But remember that the Hanbali teachings of Taymiyya, the conviction of absolute certainty that informs Aulhus Sunnah and Sunni literalism, is carried into the future by the Prophetic Methodology.</p>
<p>So this is getting too long&#8230;will be continued in <strong>Embracing Apocalypse Part II: Hanbali Literalism and the Uncreated Quran</strong></p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>As a child I was tortured nightly by brutal insomnia.  I learned to tame it and harness it by reading under the covers&#8211; sometimes reading all night long.  And my &#8220;library&#8221; was my older brothers&#8217; cast offs and hand-me-downs&#8211; exclusively science fiction and comix.</p>
<p>Now HA Hellyer, former front man for Sisi and the Tamarods (and non-resident fellow at the <a href="https://bintchaos.wordpress.com/2015/03/23/the-wretched-hive-brookings/">Brookings Institute of Gatekeeping and Griftology</a>) has penned <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/12/opinions/star-wars-isis-islam/index.html">a &#8220;satire&#8221;</a> saying Star Wars is more Islamic than IS.  Sadly, his attempt is full of fail.  There already exists a perfectly good scifi exemplar of the Islamic State&#8211; Frank Herbert&#8217;s Dune, the greatest selling scifi novel ever, which focuses intensely on a powerful and important aspect of IS ideology:  prescience, the Science of Prophecy.  Dune even has a prophesized mahdi, jihad, arabic language, and most important, rebellion.  Star Wars isnt even remotely Islamic&#8230;but the Rebel Alliance and Jedi Knights are very similiar to the Mujahiddeen.</p>
<p>Theres no prophecy in Star Wars that I recall.  I would remember, because I&#8217;m fascinated by prophecy.  And there is plenty of jihad in Dune.</p>
<blockquote><p>There was no past occupying the future in his mind… except… except… he could still sense the green and black Atreides banner waving… somewhere ahead… still see the jihad&#8217;s bloody swords and fanatic legions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Green and black banners?  Green was widely regarded as the color that represented  Shi&#8217;a Islam, and the black banners from Khorasan are the trademark of the Islamic State, tapping into both prophecy and the legacy of the Prophet (SAW).</p>
<p>Most recently IS has taken to blowing up oil infrasture in the Baiji oil refinery&#8211; a page right out of Dune&#8211; when Paul Muad&#8217;ib holds the Padishah Emperor and the Guild Navigators hostage by threatening to cause the destruction of spice production forever.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He who can destroy a thing&#8211; controls that thing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Theres even a parallel Melimah in Kralnezac, the apocryphal endtimes hurricane-typhoon that will destroy the world.  If you are looking for an insurgency similiar to the Islamic State, the Fremen have the greatest isomorphisms.  Herbert even said that spice is a metaphor for oil.  But IS is also analogous to the Browncoats of Firefly, the Jedi Knights of Star Wars, the Quellists of the Takeshi Kovacs universe, and any other underdog insurgent force fighting the oppressive domination of the oligarchs, autocrats and tyrants of the science fiction universe.</p>
<p>Would an IS movie sell to Hollywood?  Not in this frame of spacetime.  Right now the land of the &#8220;free&#8221; and the home of the &#8220;brave&#8221; is busily devolving into white-fright fascism, witness the blockbuster success of American Sniper.  Being American means never having to say you&#8217;re sorry I guess.</p>
<p>But the bottom line is that the Islamic State is the classic scifi underdog battling a seemingly all powerful Evil Empire America against impossible odds&#8211; and in the very best scifi tradition&#8211; <em>they are winning.</em></p>
