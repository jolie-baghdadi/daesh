496905077165404160,2014-08-06 06:26:17,@truthsMaster @ShamiWitness it makes sense. and bay'ah is supposed to be public or at least known by the masses far as I know.

496896017502330880,2014-08-06 05:50:17,@ShamiWitness I see your points akhi. I still feel it seems very weird that there would be an AQ branch with a hidden bay'ah
496895864024346624,2014-08-06 05:49:40,@Ummah4Life no that did not answer my question. can you give me proof from shari'a which invalidates their claim?
496895346925387776,2014-08-06 05:47:37,@ShamiWitness and its also weird how these letters were not seen until the talk by Zawahiri.
